# Singly Linked List Simulation (C++ Project)

This project is a **menu-driven simulation of a Singly Linked List** implemented in **C++**.  
It allows users to perform all major linked list operations through an interactive console interface.

This project was created as part of a **Data Structures Simulation** assignment.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 🔹 **Basic Operations**
- Insert at Front
- Insert at End
- Insert at a Specific Position
- Delete from Front
- Delete from End
- Delete from a Specific Position
- Search for an Element
- Display the Linked List

### 🔹 **Additional Advanced Features**
- Count total nodes  
- Reverse the linked list  
- Insert elements in sorted order  
- Delete a node by value  
- Find the middle element (Tortoise-Hare Method)  
- Detect cycle in the list (Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm)  
- Clear the entire linked list  
- Destructor to free memory automatically

## 📌 **Cycle Formation Note**
The linked list operations in this implementation **do not create cycles naturally**.  
Cycle detection is included only as an **advanced feature** to demonstrate understanding of pointer algorithms.

## 🧠 **How It Works (Menu-Driven Program)**

The program repeatedly displays this menu:

================ LINKED LIST MENU ================

Insert at Front
Insert at End
Insert at Position
Delete from Front
Delete from End
Delete from Position
Search an Element
Count Nodes
Reverse Linked List
Insert in Sorted Order
Delete by Value
Show Middle Element
Detect Cycle
Clear Linked List

Exit
==================================================


Users choose an option and enter required values.  
The linked list updates instantly and is displayed before each iteration.

## 📂 **Project Structure**
- `Node` class → Represents a single linked list node  
- `LinkedList` class → Contains all operations  
- Menu-driven `main()` function → Allows user interaction  

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **C++**
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
- Pointer manipulation
- Classic Linked List algorithms
