# Singly Linked List Simulation (C++ Project)

This project is a **menu-driven simulation of a Singly Linked List** implemented in **C++**.  
It allows users to perform all major linked list operations through an interactive console interface.

This project was created as part of a **Data Structures Simulation** assignment.

##  Features Implemented

### **Basic Operations**
- Insert at Front
- Insert at End
- Insert at a Specific Position
- Delete from Front
- Delete from End
- Delete from a Specific Position
- Search for an Element
- Display the Linked List

###  **Additional Advanced Features**
- Count total nodes  
- Reverse the linked list  
- Insert elements in sorted order  
- Delete a node by value  
- Find the middle element (Tortoise-Hare Method)  
- Detect cycle in the list (Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm)  
- Clear the entire linked list  
- Destructor to free memory automatically

##  **Cycle Formation Note**
The linked list operations in this implementation **do not create cycles naturally**.  
Cycle detection is included only as an **advanced feature** to demonstrate understanding of pointer algorithms.

##  **How It Works (Menu-Driven Program)**

The program repeatedly displays this menu:

================ LINKED LIST MENU ================

- Insert at Front
- Insert at End
- Insert at Position
- Delete from Front
- Delete from End
- Delete from Position
- Search an Element
- Count Nodes
- Reverse Linked List
- Insert in Sorted Order
- Delete by Value
- Show Middle Element
- Detect Cycle
- Clear Linked List

Exit
==================================================


Users choose an option and enter required values.  
The linked list updates instantly and is displayed before each iteration.

##  **Project Structure**
- `Node` class → Represents a single linked list node  
- `LinkedList` class → Contains all operations  
- Menu-driven `main()` function → Allows user interaction  

---

##  **Technologies Used**
- **C++**
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
- Pointer manipulation
- Classic Linked List algorithms
